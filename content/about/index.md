# Hi, I'm Suely 👋

I am a Data Engineer focused on building robust data pipelines and scalable cloud infrastructure. My journey into technology started with a healthy dose of skepticism—for a long time, the "Cloud" felt like a maze of invisible concepts that I preferred to avoid.



## Why "Cloud Unclouded"?
I started this blog because I believe that technical knowledge shouldn't be gated behind confusing jargon. After moving from being intimidated by the cloud to working within it daily, I realized that the best way to master a concept is to break it down until it is simple enough for anyone to understand.

This space is where I "uncloud" the complexities of:
* **Data Engineering:** Designing efficient systems to move and transform data.
* **Infrastructure:** Understanding the backbone of modern applications.
* **Continuous Learning:** Documenting the puzzles I solve and the tools I discover.

## My Approach
I don't just write about how things work; I write about how they *actually* feel when you're learning them. Whether you are a student, a career-changer, or a fellow engineer, I hope my insights help you navigate your own technical journey with more confidence.
