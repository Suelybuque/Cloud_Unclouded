For a long time, cloud computing felt too big and too abstract for me, especially in the past as a student starting out and still figuring out the basics of tech.

Every time I heard people talk about it, it sounded like a world made of invisible concepts (regions, billing accounts, services), all layered on top of each other. Nothing felt concrete. Nothing felt familiar.
Instead of seeing cloud as a tool, I saw it as a maze of terminology I wasn’t ready to navigate. I worried that one wrong click would cost money, or that I needed to understand everything before even starting.

So I ran from it.

Whenever cloud came up, I told myself I’d learn it “later”. I focused on what felt safer, what I already understood, and quietly avoided the thing that intimidated me the most.

## What I Thought Cloud Was

Before diving in, I want to reflect for a moment on how my fear shaped these assumptions.

Before actually trying to learn cloud, I had built my own version of what I thought it was, and most of it was wrong.

I thought cloud was just a collection of expensive servers somewhere far away, a place to store files instead of using physical storage like hard drives or USBs. It felt detached from anything I was used to working with.

I also believed cloud was only for big companies with massive budgets and dedicated teams. In my mind, it wasn’t something meant for students or small projects.

Another misconception I had was that cloud computing was mainly for DevOps engineers. I assumed you needed deep infrastructure and networking knowledge before even getting started, which immediately made it feel out of reach.

I questioned its security as well. Trusting my data to “the cloud” didn’t feel safe, especially when I didn’t fully understand where that data lived or who controlled it.

At the same time, I had contradictory ideas about cost. I thought cloud was cheaper by default, that simply moving things there would automatically reduce expenses. What I didn’t realize then was that while cloud can reduce costs, poor configuration and lack of monitoring can make it far more expensive than expected.

I believed backups weren’t necessary either. That once something was in the cloud, it was automatically safe. Almost as if you could upload something and it would just *automagically* work.

## What Cloud Actually Is

According to IBM:

> *“Cloud computing is on-demand access to computing resources — physical or virtual servers, data storage, networking capabilities, application development tools, software, AI-powered analytic platforms and more — over the internet with pay-per-use pricing.”*

That definition was exactly what scared me.

It felt dense, abstract, and overwhelming. At the beginning, I genuinely thought I wasn’t smart enough to understand cloud computing and  that it was simply too complex for me.

So I did what many humans do when faced with something unknown and intimidating:

 ***I ran from it.***

But eventually, I found a way to *debunk* the concept of cloud for people like me.

And once I did, I realized something important:

***Cloud isn’t as complicated as it sounds.***

## The Explanation That Finally Clicked

The explanation that finally made cloud make sense to me was this:

> ***Cloud is like renting an apartment instead of building a house.***


When you build a house, everything is your responsibility. You buy the land, pay for construction, handle electricity, plumbing, security, maintenance and if something breaks, you fix it. That’s how traditional, on-premise computing works.

You buy physical servers, set them up, maintain them, secure them, and upgrade them over time. It works, but it’s expensive, time-consuming, and not very flexible.

Renting an apartment, on the other hand, is different.

You don’t own the building, but you get to live in it and use everything you need. You pay only for the space and utilities you use, and maintenance is handled by someone else. If you need a bigger place, you move. If you need less, you downsize. That’s what cloud computing feels like.

Instead of buying and managing physical servers, you rent computing resources over the internet. You use virtual machines instead of physical ones, online storage instead of hard drives, and managed services instead of setting everything up yourself.

You still have responsibilities, such as  configuring your resources, securing your applications, managing costs, but you no longer worry about the physical infrastructure underneath. That part is handled for you.

Once I understood cloud this way, it stopped feeling abstract and started feeling learnable.

## When It Started to Make Sense

Cloud computing truly started to make sense when I realized how deeply it’s embedded in our daily lives.

Messaging apps. Streaming platforms. Online storage. Even the tools we use to study and work.

Almost everything we do on the internet relies on the cloud in one way or another.

That realization made me pause.

If cloud is already part of almost everything we interact with online, why wasn’t I learning about it?  
Why did it feel so distant, when I was already using it every single day?

That’s when I decided to stop avoiding it and start going deeper, not because I suddenly knew everything, but because I finally understood that cloud wasn’t foreign.

It was already part of my life.

## What Helped Me Feel Less Scared

It’s important to know that feeling intimidated by cloud is completely normal.

The first thing I had to accept was that it was okay not to understand everything at once.

Cloud computing isn’t something you grasp overnight, and expecting myself to do so only made it more intimidating. I learned to be okay with confusion, to see it not as a failure, but as part of the learning process.

I also accepted that I didn’t need to know everything. I’m only human, after all. 
Understanding cloud doesn’t require mastering every service, tool, or concept from the beginning. It starts with learning one thing at a time and allowing knowledge to build gradually.

Another big shift was *letting go of information overload*.
 With the number of resources available online today, it’s incredibly easy to feel overwhelmed. Tutorials, courses, documentation, opinions, all competing for attention.

Instead of trying to consume everything, I learned to be intentional about what I studied and to focus on what mattered for where I was in my journey.

## What I’d Tell Someone Who’s Scared of Cloud

If cloud computing scares you, my biggest advice is this: **Avoid information overload.**

Learn one concept at a time and give yourself permission to move slowly. This isn’t a race.

Choose progress over perfection. You don’t need to master everything to get started. In fact, trying to do so will only hold you back.

Cloud isn’t magic. It’s infrastructure. And like any infrastructure, it has layers upon layers of depth. You don’t need to unravel all of them at once. Trust me, it will drive you insane.

Instead, focus on small wins. Deploy something simple. Understand one service. Break things and learn why they broke.

Start small, stay consistent, and let curiosity guide you.

If I could go from running away from cloud to wanting to learn it, so can you.
**See you on the next one.**🤍
